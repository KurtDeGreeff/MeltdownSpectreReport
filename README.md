## Execution against multiple computers
```powershell
    PS C:\> $ComputerName = Get-ADComputer -Filter * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name
        $Report = .\MeltdownSpectreReport.ps1 -ComputerName $ComputerName
        $Report | ConvertTo-Csv -NoTypeInformation -Delimiter ',' | Out-File C:\report.csv
        $Report | Out-GridView
```

# Properties
## isHyperV
Is `true` if `vmms` Service is running. Hypervisors are at increased risk.
## isTerminalServer
Is `true` if `TerminalServerMode` is `1`. Terminal Servers (Remote Desktop Servers) are at increased risk.
## BTI
BTI is *Branch Target Injection* as described in [CVE-2017-5715](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715) alias [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/).

`BTIHardwarePresent` is `true` if the Hardware supports a mitigation. Check for BIOS/firmware updates provided by your device OEM.

`BTIWindowsSupportPresent` is `true` if the required Windows security update is installed. 

`BTIWindowsSupportEnabled` is `true` the Branch Target Injection mitigation is effective.

## KVA
KVA checks OS mitigation against [CVE-2017-5754](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754) alias [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/).

## OSMitigationEnabled
As per [Windows Server guidance to protect against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4072698
):

> Customers need to enable mitigations to help protect against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities.
> 
> Enabling these mitigations may affect performance. The actual performance impact will depend on multiple factors, such as the specific chipset in your physical host and the workloads that are running. Microsoft recommends that customers assess the performance impact for their environment and make necessary adjustments.

`OSMitigationEnabled` is `true` if the values for the registry key `Memory Management` are set as required, i.e. `FeatureSettingsOverride` is `0` and `FeatureSettingsOverrideMask` is `3`.

To create the required values, you can use the following PowerShell commands:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management' -PropertyType 'DWORD' -Value '0'  -Name 'FeatureSettingsOverride'
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management' -PropertyType 'DWORD' -Value '3'  -Name 'FeatureSettingsOverrideMask'
```

## AVCompatibility
As per [Important information regarding the Windows security updates released on January 3, 2018 and anti-virus software](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4072699), the security updates are only installed, if the registry value `cadca5fe-87d3-4b96-b7fb-a231484277cc` is present in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\QualityCompat`. 

The value is either set by the the installed Anti-Virus, or must be set manually if no Anti-Virus is installed.

To add the value manually, you can use the following line of PowerShell:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\QualityCompat' -Name 'cadca5fe-87d3-4b96-b7fb-a231484277cc' -PropertyType DWord -Value '0x00000000'
```
*Note: Only use this command, if you don't have any Anti-Virus installed, or verified that it's compatible!*

## Chrome
`ChromeVersion` is the file version of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`. 

As per [Googleâ€™s Mitigations Against CPU Speculative Execution Attack Methods](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138) it is possible to enable [Site Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation) in Chrome version 63, to, at least, partly mitigate the issue. 

Earlier versions do not have a mitigation implemented.

For Chrome 64 further mitigations are announced. 

`ChromeSitePerProcess` is `true` if `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\SitePerProcess` is `1`. See also [Policy List/SitePerProcess](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#SitePerProcess).
